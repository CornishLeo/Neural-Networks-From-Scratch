# Neural-Networks-From-Scratch
A project to implement neural networks from scratch (using PyTorch Tensors for backpropagation).

This project aims to deliver a functional AI framework loosely based on PyTorch and inspired by the teachings of Andrej Karpathy. The goal is to deepen my understanding of the foundational mathematics behind neural networks, such as gradient descent.

While PyTorch tensors will be used for efficiency, a custom Value class will demonstrate backpropagation from scratch for singular values.
